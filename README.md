I used API through Postman to made a project where I did a connection between the database and the program.
I filtered the HTTP methods Get, Post, Put and Delete using a Controller.
This is the url of the project https://localhost:7149/api/Usuarios
GET -> https://localhost:7149/api/Usuarios
GET(only an user) -> https://localhost:7149/api/Usuarios/(the id of the user)
POST -> https://localhost:7149/api/Usuarios
PUT -> https://localhost:7149/api/Usuarios
DELETE -> https://localhost:7149/api/Usuarios/(the id of the user)
